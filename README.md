# Example Command Based FRC Robot Structure

This is an example command-based robot template for explaining the function, structure, and creation of command-based robots.

## Usage

To run this code, deploy to the robot using the `Deploy Robot Code` button. Then open  `FRC Driver Station` and connect a XBox controller to your computer, making sure its ID is 0 inside the USB menu. Click the green `Enable` button.

Once its been enabled, the robot will print `(0, 0)`, moving the right joystick on the xbox controller will cause the values to reflect the `x` and `y` positions of the joystick.
